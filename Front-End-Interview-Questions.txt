JS Questions:[

{question:"Explain event delegation",

answer:"Event delegation allows you to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes;
instead, the event listener is added to one parent.  That event listener
analyzes bubbled events to find a match on child elements.",

{question:"Explain how this works in JavaScript",

answer:"In typical object-oriented programming, we need a way of identifying and referring to the object that we’re currently working with. this serves the purpose admirably, providing our objects the ability to examine themselves, and point at their own properties.

 <script type="text/javascript"> 
  var deep_thought = { 
   the_answer: 42, 
   ask_question: function () { 
    return this.the_answer; 
   } 
  }; 
  
  var the_meaning = deep_thought.ask_question(); 
 </script>

This example builds an object named deep_thought, sets its the_answer property to 42, and creates an ask_question method. When deep_thought.ask_question() is executed, JavaScript establishes an execution context for the function call, setting this to the object referenced by whatever came before the last ”.”, in this case: deep_thought. The method can then look in the mirror via this to examine its own properties, returning the value stored in this.the_answer: 42.",
